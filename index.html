            <p> <b> Ayodhya </b>(legendary city) ยง Historicity
                Ancient Indian Sanskrit-language epics, such as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata mention a legendary
                city
                called Ayodhya, which was the capital of the legendary Ikshvaku kings of Kosala, including Rama.[28]
                Neither
                these texts, nor the earlier Sanskrit texts such as the Vedas, mention a city called Saketa.
                Non-religious,
                non-legendary ancient Sanskrit texts, such as Panini's Ashtadhyayi and Patanjali's commentary on it, do
                mention Saketa.[28] The later Buddhist text Mahavastu describes Saketa as the seat of the Ikshvaku king
                Sujata, whose descendants established the Shakya capital Kapilavastu.</p>
